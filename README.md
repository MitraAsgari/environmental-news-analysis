# Environmental News Analysis for Issue and Trend Identification

Developed NLP models to analyze environmental news articles and identify key issues and trends using the Kaggle Environmental News Dataset. Preprocessed text data and implemented LDA for topic modeling and BERT for sentiment analysis. Evaluated models with coherence scores and classification metrics, and visualized results with various plots.

## Features
- Text data preprocessing
- LDA for topic modeling
- BERT for sentiment analysis
- Model evaluation and result visualization
